>I was very confused about what this assignment comprised of/was asking for,
so I went to tutoring with Matteo for help. The questions I had were as follows:
-
>How is the user determining the value?
Understanding the difference between "for in in range" vs "for j in range"(nest
loops)?
How do I format this so that there are not just spaces, but also a line break
to create the vertical nature of the pyramid?
###

>Once these questions I was able to develop the outline of the code with Matteo.
Some syntax errors we ran into were defining what was in the inner vs outer
loop and spacing/parentheses issues, missing colons at ends of line of code.

> There are a few things that I partially understood in the tutoring session
that I think I would continue to be confused about writing on my own. The
formatting of the first line of user input is still not 100 percent clear. I
fully understand what the line is telling the user to do, but why some spaces/
parentheses are there is still unclear to me. I also think I could understand
the relationship between the nested loop and indentations more clearly.
