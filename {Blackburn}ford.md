#### 2.3 - How does code become software?
-
>Computer = clock with benefits; software starts as code.
Code used to putting holes in punch cards to be operated by as the computer
flipped through the cards. Keyboard code in programming language K. Compilers

Every character/space/etc matters because the computer is reading and
interpreting everything.
