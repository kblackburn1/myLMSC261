# Github Troll - Kayla Blackburn
-
The project I "trolled" was an AR & 3D modeling product previewing tool by 'shaddeykatri'. This project was made with Angular CLI, that runs off of HTML and TypeScript. There were numerous changes to the project's structure and UI in the JavaScript Object Notation files. In the section labeled as "swiper autoplay", the code was updated organize catgories of products into subcategories and to develop a more efficient way of swiping through products. Throughout the course of the week, they also developed a detailed Markdown with instructions on running the AR application. The comments were not very helpful, so I had to investigate the changes as they came on my own in each file and folder, some real trolling! There was one other contributor on this project who was putting in just as much work as the owner of the repository, with similar file labeling nomenclature and an equal number of commits to the repository in the past week.
