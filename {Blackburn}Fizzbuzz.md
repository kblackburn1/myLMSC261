# Fizzbuzz Markdown - Kayla Blackburn

This assingment was not particularly difficult because I was able to break down the steps into what I had already understood and from lines of code I could find from the class Github.

However, I struggled to get the first step counter working.
I repeatedly used some line of code that I had found from some searching online. The problem was not that I didn't understand how to develop an index range, rather I didn't understand how I would be printing those integers. It was as simple as just an else statement at the end if the conditions of printing fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz. Once this worked, I was shocked at how long I spent on the front half of the code when for a while it was already correct and I just needed on more line at the end. 

###Explanation of My Code
-
#### Step 1 -
Create an index range between 1 & 100.

##### Step 2 - 
If a number is divisible by 3 with no remainder, print fizz.

##### Step 3 -

If a number is divisble by 5 with no remainder, print buzz.

#####Step 4 - 
If a number is divisible 3 & 5 with no remainder, print fizz buzz.

#####Step 5 -
If the above conditions are not met, print the sequential integer in the index range provided in step 1.
