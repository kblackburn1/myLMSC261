Writeup: This project was pretty straightforward. We had some issues figuring out branches at first. We all wrote individual bios. I included audio, Marc included a picture, and Nathaniel made the CSS file. The only issue were the merge erros that continously happened because Nathaniel, who hosted the site, would edit lines Marc and I were working on before we finished. He had deleted a line of my code and duplicated sections of the site's formatting, but we were able to troubleshoot as a group and resolve it.
