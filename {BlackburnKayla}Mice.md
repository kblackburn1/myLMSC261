# Mice Markdown - Kayla Blackburn
--


This assignment opened up my vocabulary in Python since I was working on assignments in backwords order. The code was relatively straightforward once I learned \ n = new line and \ t = indent. 

My initial code was as follows: print("3 \n Blind \n Mice")

I, then, ran the program, saw the indentation issues and corrected to as follows: print("3\n\tBlind\n\t\t\tMice")
